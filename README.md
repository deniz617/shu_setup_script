# Shu Setup Script
Personal desktop enviroment & reverse engineering tool setup script

## Desktop setup script
Installs xfce, i3 and some other stuff. Will be updated on future if i change my setup, im fine with it fow now.

## Tool setup script
This is useless, i've done ZERO reverse engineering on Linux so far i have no experience with the linux tools for reverse engineering i just put some tools that were looking nice to checkout. PEDA, PWNDBG, PWNTOOLS, BN.

### Note
This script is meant to be used mainly by myself to make it easier to setup a new VM and PC..
This is my first script and it can said that im new to linux.
Also i wrote this while being on Kali, but it should work on almost all Debian based distros.
